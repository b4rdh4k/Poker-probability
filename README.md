This repository holds a project made for the class of Mathematics for Computer Science, taught by instructor: Armend Shabani for the educational technology institute LIFE from Gjirafa. 
For the completion of this project, I have decided to take on the problem of finding the probabilities of each type of hand in five-card poker and ranking the types of hands by their probability. 
This is directly inspired by the book "Discrete mathematics and its applications" by Kenneth H. Rossen. Y
ou can find it in the 7th chapter of the book (Discrete probability, pg. 525) under the section of "Computations and Explorations), exercise 1.

TO-DO: add process

p.s. If you're not in the mood for poker and discrete maths, watch Casino Royale as a pre-requisite :3.
